Mini Loan App Welcome to the Mini Loan App! This application provides a platform for managing loans for both administrators and clients.

About the Application The Mini Loan App offers a seamless experience for users to register, request loans with customized terms, and manage their repayments. Administrators have the authority to review loan requests, approve or reject them, and monitor the overall loan portfolio.

User Registration and Loan Request Users can easily register on the platform by providing necessary details. Once registered, they can submit loan requests specifying the desired loan amount and repayment terms. The application allows users to customize repayment schedules based on their financial preferences.

Repayment Management Upon approval, users are notified, and they can start making weekly payments towards their loans. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing repayments, tracking payment history.

Additional Loan Requests Users have the flexibility to request additional loan amounts if needed. Whether it's for unexpected expenses or personal investments, users can submit new loan requests..
